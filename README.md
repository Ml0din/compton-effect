Project Purpose

The project involves developing software to simulate the scattering angle of an electron based on the Compton effect. This is a fundamental phenomenon in the field of quantum physics and radiation, describing the interaction between photons and electrons. Understanding and simulating this effect has extensive applications in various fields such as nuclear physics, particle physics, and astrophysics.
The primary goal of this project is to create a simulation tool that allows science students to explore and better understand the behavior of electrons following Compton scattering. Specifically, my software aims to:
   
Visualize photon-electron interactions: Provide a clear and intuitive graphical representation of how photons change their trajectory after collisions with matter.

Predict scattering angles: Accurately calculate the electron's scattering angle based on the initial energy of the photon and the interaction conditions.

Education and training: Create an interactive educational environment for students, facilitating the understanding of theoretical concepts through simulated practical experiences.
